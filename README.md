# Simple-Physics-Engine

Currently, this project contains only a Ballistic Demo,where I focus on rendering spheres and showcasing fundamental kinematic laws, such as motion, velocity, and acceleration. 
The simulation provides a visual representation of how these laws govern the behavior of objects in motion.
