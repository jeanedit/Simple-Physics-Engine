# Simple-Physics-Engine

Currently, this project contains a Ballistic Demo and a Fireworks Demo ,where I focus on rendering objects and showcasing fundamental kinematic laws, such as motion, velocity, and acceleration. 
The simulation provides a visual representation of how these laws govern the behavior of objects in motion.
